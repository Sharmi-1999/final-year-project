        Everyone wants the best job. Be it a fresher or an experienced
        candidate. There is always a different definition of best. For some, the
        best is a 9-5 job while some prefer flexible hours and the profile that
        they want. However, one of the significant factors to decide is the type
        of company you are getting into. There are advertising agencies,
        startups, product-based, service-based companies, and more. You make a
        choice either on what you like or with your past experience. In this
        article, we will explore one of the important types of companies. We
        will be looking at what are service-based companies, some of the top
        service-based companies in India, and how to get into one. A
        service-based company is the one that provides customers, clients the
        ultimate solution to their requirements or a service to another company.
        The service offered by the company is intangible and can be provided in
        the form of skills, amenities, and expertise. For example, a great IT
        Software solution for your company is how a service-based company
        provides its value to the client.
